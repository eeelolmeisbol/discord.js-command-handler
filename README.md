## Discord.js Command Handler
Hello and welcome to the quick tutorial on how to make a command handler in a github repo :D
This is a quick tutorial so don't expect this to be a full bot. you can easily install it and use it. It only has one "hi" command for a example. You might learn more about commands in some youtube/web tutorials. I also recommend going to: https://discord.js.org

#Installing Packages
To get the gtihub repo use: `$ git clone https://github.com/eeelolmeisbol/discord.js-command-handler/edit/master/README.md`

*Then make sure to open terminal.*
Use: `npm install discord.js`to install discord.js packages.

Now thats all! lets get into getting our bot token and editing some files.
